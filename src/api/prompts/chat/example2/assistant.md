The Navier-Stokes equation is given by:

$$
\rho \left( \frac{\partial \textbf{u}}{\partial t} + \textbf{u} \cdot \nabla \textbf{u} \right) = - \nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \textbf{u} + \textbf{f}
$$

where:

- $\rho$ is the fluid density,
- $\textbf{u}$ is the fluid velocity vector,
- $t$ is time,
- $p$ is the pressure,
- $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity,
- $\nabla$ is the gradient operator,
- $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator, and
- $\textbf{f}$ is the external force per unit volume.
