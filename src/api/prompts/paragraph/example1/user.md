# Passé Composé

The passé composé is formed by using the auxiliary verb "avoir" or "etre" and the past participle of the main verb. The auxiliary verb is conjugated in the present tense, while the past participle remains unchanged.

For example, the passé composé of "Je vais à la gare" (I go to the station) is <MASK>
