<THOUGHT>
This is a list of the ACID principles in database management. The "Consistency" and "Isolation" principles are missing and so must be inserted in a consistent format.

Consistency: Transactions maintain database validity by transitioning it between consistent states.
- Isolation: Transactions execute independently, preventing interference between concurrent operations.
