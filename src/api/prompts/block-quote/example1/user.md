# Adam Smith's Invisible Hand

Adam Smith, in his seminal work "The Wealth of Nations," coined the term "invisible hand" to describe the self-regulating nature of markets.

> Every individual... neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it... he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, <MARK>
